# Terraform provider for Opal

## SDK Generation
Generate the new SDK using `speakeasy run`. This pulls the remote spec specified in `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml#6` and applies the overrides in `terraform_overlay.yaml`. Note the Makefile is only useful if you want to do development with a local OpenAPI spec and update the Speakeasy workflow config to reference that OpenAPI spec.

## Installation

To install this provider, copy and paste this code into your Terraform configuration. Then, run `terraform init`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    opal = {
      source  = "opalsecurity/opal"
      version = "0.24.6"
    }
  }
}

provider "opal" {
  # Configuration options
}
```
<!-- End Installation [installation] -->


<!-- Start Testing the provider locally [usage] -->
## Testing the provider locally

#### Local Provider

Should you want to validate a change locally, the `--debug` flag allows you to execute the provider against a terraform instance locally.

This also allows for debuggers (e.g. delve) to be attached to the provider.

```sh
go run main.go --debug
# Copy the TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS env var
# In a new terminal
cd examples/your-example
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS=... terraform init
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS=... terraform apply
```

#### Compiled Provider

Terraform allows you to use local provider builds by setting a `dev_overrides` block in a configuration file called `.terraformrc`. This block overrides all other configured installation methods.

1. Execute `go build` to construct a binary called `terraform-provider-opal`
2. Ensure that the `.terraformrc` file is configured with a `dev_overrides` section such that your local copy of terraform can see the provider binary

Terraform searches for the `.terraformrc` file in your home directory and applies any configuration settings you set.

```
provider_installation {

  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/opalsecurity/opal" = "<PATH>"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```
